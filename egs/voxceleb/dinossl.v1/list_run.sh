# Why this is directory is created:
## To run DINO-based SSL for utterance-level embedding learning

# How this directory is created:
## 1. Run below in the parent directory:
## cp -r v1.1 dinossl.v1
## 2. instead of running scripts before run_011*: preparing data (This part will be updated after updating training-related codes first)
## ln -s /export/c01/jcho/hyperion_DINO/egs/voxceleb/v1.1/data data
